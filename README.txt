Description:
Biometric systems have become a major part of research due its application of identification. Code provides biometric system using finger print modality. The proposed methodology uses standard deviation of pre-defined block of DCT coefficient as feature vector. Recognition process is   being done by performing distance measurement between feature vector of testing and training data set. Testing and training is done on students database of College of Engineering Pune 

The source folder contains 2 m-files: 
a)Finng_Training_50.m: This program performs feature level extraction of fingerprint of 50 students (6 images each). The image is converted into feature vector of 1 x 39. This program is used to create training sets. Feature is stored in text file name "features_fingure_new.txt".
 
b)FINger_Testing_50.m: This program performs feature level extraction of finger print of 50 students (2 images each). The image is converted into feature vector of 1 x 39. This program is used to create training sets. Feature is stored in text file name "features_fingure_test_im_new.txt".


Note: The user can directly run the m-file ” FINger_Testing_50.m” as file containing training and testing feature vector of finger print is already stored in source code folder. But in program address need to be change.
